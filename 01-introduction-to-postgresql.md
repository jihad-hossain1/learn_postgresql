# Introduction to PostgreSQL

## What is PostgreSQL?

PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source object-relational database management system (ORDBMS) that has been in active development for over 30 years. It's known for its reliability, feature robustness, and performance.

## Key Features

- **ACID Compliance**: Ensures data integrity through Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability
- **Extensibility**: Support for custom data types, operators, and functions
- **Standards Compliance**: Follows SQL standards closely
- **Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC)**: Allows multiple transactions to access the same data simultaneously
- **Cross-Platform**: Runs on various operating systems
- **Open Source**: Free to use with active community support

## PostgreSQL vs Other Databases

| Feature | PostgreSQL | MySQL | SQLite |
|---------|------------|-------|--------|
| ACID Compliance | Full | Partial | Full |
| JSON Support | Native | Limited | Limited |
| Extensibility | High | Medium | Low |
| Concurrency | MVCC | Locking | Locking |
| Performance | High | High | Medium |

## Use Cases

- **Web Applications**: E-commerce, content management systems
- **Data Analytics**: Business intelligence, reporting
- **Geospatial Applications**: GIS systems with PostGIS extension
- **Financial Systems**: Banking, trading platforms
- **Scientific Applications**: Research data management

## Installation Overview

### Windows
1. Download installer from postgresql.org
2. Run the installer and follow setup wizard
3. Configure port (default: 5432) and password

### macOS
```bash
# Using Homebrew
brew install postgresql
brew services start postgresql
```

### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib
sudo systemctl start postgresql
```

## Basic Concepts

- **Database**: Container for related data
- **Schema**: Logical grouping of database objects
- **Table**: Structure that holds data in rows and columns
- **Row/Record**: Individual data entry
- **Column/Field**: Data attribute
- **Primary Key**: Unique identifier for rows
- **Foreign Key**: Reference to primary key in another table
